            <img src="img/me.jpg" alt="Picture of me">
            <p>I am a <strong>hard working</strong> individual, who is learning more and more that i love coding!
              i have a <em>great work ethic</em>, and am very personable! I grew up in the Seattle area,
              and have been intrested in Technology since i was young, and have been looking for
              ways to get more knowledge in the arena. In highschool i took Cisco a program that
              taught me how to do manage and create computer networks both wireless and hard lined.
              While i enjoyed the experience it didnt quite click with me as most of it is knowing,
              how to check if cables are plugged in, and if they are how to turn something off then
              back on again. For years i looked for a new passion trying out all sorts of things
              like the Army reserves and joining a conservation corps team. While i had fun working
              with my body and met some awesome people, nothing quite clicked with me. One of my
              close friends currently working for Parametric suggested i become a coder so i looked into it, and it
              seemed right up my ally. I looked at the best ways to get a job in the industry and
              that pursuit led me to Epicodus.
